Keep in mind though guys, the Royal Family of Qatar didn’t buy the series – they bought just that one painting for ~259 million). The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne’s art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a “prelude” to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.The models for the paintings were local farm hands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as “human still life”, while another speculated that the men’s intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter’s absorption in his art."

Van Gogh started painting Irises within a week of entering the asylum, in May 1889, working from nature in the hospital garden. There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works. He called painting ""the lightning conductor for my illness"" because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint. The painting was probably influenced by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time. The similarities occur with strong outlines, unusual angles, including close-up views, and also flattish local colour (not modelled according to the fall of light). He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it, although Theo, Van Gogh's brother, thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889, together with Starry Night Over the Rhone.

The earlier series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, executed a year later in Arles, shows bouquets of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit."

It is a part of the Death and Disaster series painted by Andy Warhol in 1963. The painting is attributed to Warhol himself, but it is assumed that his assistant Gerard Malanga had a huge contribution to this creation. Green Car Crash is one of the highly valued paintings of this collection. Green Car Crash was finished in 1963. It was inspired by some photographs taken by John Whitehead and published in the Newsweek magazine. The car was pursued by the Seattle police. The driver lost control of the wheel at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h), crashing into a utility pole. Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) is the only Warhol ""Burning Car"" painting of five (all based on Whitehead's photograph) to utilize a color other than black and white."

The three-panel work aims at celebrating one of the most important relationships in Bacon's life. John Edwards was the closest friend and companion of the artist from 1976 until Bacon's death in April 1992, and he was named as the sole beneficiary of Bacon's will. Edwards was the subject of more than twenty of Bacon's paintings; these were painted exclusively from photographs and from memory, never from life. Edwards oversaw the British artist's archives until his death in 2003.

The primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of hay in the field after the harvest season. The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) begun in the end of summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year's harvest. Some use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same theme. The series is known for its thematic use of repetition to show differences in perception of light across various times of day, seasons, and types of weather. The subjects were painted in fields near Monet's home and gardens in Giverny, France."
